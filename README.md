# Yami-Chrome-Extension
A chrome extension for google docs that lets you create and use a custom dark mode.

There are 5 preset colors, but if those don't catch your eye you can create your own in the options page.

To use the chrome extension, first download all the files together. Then open up chrome and go to "chrome://extensions". Turn on "developer mode" (on the top right) and then click "load unpacked", at which you point you select the folder that holds all of the downloaded files.
